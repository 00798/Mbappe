In 2016 at the UEFA European Under-19 Championship, Mbappé led France’s national team to victory. He played his first match with the French men’s 
national team in 2017, and he soon emerged as one of its main scoring threats. During the 2018 World Cup he became—at age 19—the youngest French 
player ever to score in World Cup competition. His goal gave France a 1–0 group-stage victory over Peru, and the French team advanced to the knockout
stages of the tournament, where it eventually defeated Croatia 4–2 in the tournament’s final. Mbappé scored the last of his team’s goals, becoming 
the second teenager to score in a World Cup final. (Pelé was the first, in 1958.) Mbappé received the World Cup’s Best Young Player award for his 
performance, which included scoring four goals.In 2021 Mbappé scored the winning goal for France in the final of the UEFA Nations League tournament, 
defeating Spain. At the 2022 World Cup he scored eight goals in seven matches—the most of any player in the tournament, which won him the Golden Boot
award. In the tournament final, Mbappé scored three goals and twice brought the French team from behind to tie Argentina, which was led by his PSG 
teammate Messi, but France ultimately lost on penalty kicks. With his three goals, Mbappé became the first player in history to have tallied four 
career World Cup final goals.</h2>
