Born in the capital in 1998 and raised in a sporting family in the Parisian suburb of Bondy, Kylian Mbappé first joined the French National Football
Institution at Clairefontaine before moving to Monaco’s academy. At the age of 17, the prodigy exploded onto the European scene and became a Ligue 1
champion in 2017.Signed by Paris Saint-Germain just a few weeks later, the man that led Les Bleus to World Cup glory in 2018 quickly became a key 
player in Rouge et Bleu.The third-highest goal scorer in club history, the Paris No.7 has developed an unquenchable thirst for records. He has 
finished as the league’s top scorer four times and won the Ligue 1 Player of the Year award three times. During a remarkable 2021/22 season,
he moved into second place in the Club’s all-time scoring chart, and finished the campaign as the player with the most goal involvements across 
Europe (42).Despite being coveted by all of European football, ‘KM7’ opted to sign a new contract to continue his love affair with the City of Light.</h2>
